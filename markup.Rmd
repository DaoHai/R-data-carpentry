This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(shiny)

#load the data from website 
surveys_raw <- read.csv("http://files.figshare.com/1919744/surveys.csv")

surveys_complete <- surveys_raw %>% filter(species_id !="") %>% #pipe should be the end of line rather than beginning of new line
                                filter(!is.na(weight)) %>% 
                                filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length))
```
Plotting things
```{r}
ggplot(data=surveys_complete, aes(x=weight, y=hindfoot_length))+geom_point(alpha=0.1, color="blue")
```

Plotting things interactively and choose a color
```{r}
selectInput("data", "", c("blue","black"))
renderPlot({
  #d<-get(input$data)
  ggplot(data=surveys_complete, aes(x=weight, y=hindfoot_length))+geom_point(alpha=0.1, color=input$data)
})

```
